in her contract specifically asking for anatomical and career changes In addition it is my understanding that disparaging remarks were made about me my ability to please and some of my fashion choices would like to take this opportunity to inform you of some issues concerning Ms Barbie and some of my own needs and desires First of all along with several other colleagues feel Barbie DOES NOT deserve preferential treatment the bitch has everything along with Joe Jem Raggedy Ann Andy DO NOT have dreamhouse Corvette evening gowns and in some cases the ability to change our hair style personally have only outfits which am forced to mix and match at great length My decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice too would like change in my career Have you ever considered Decorator Ken Beauty Salon Ken or Out Of Work Actor Ken In addition there are several other avenues which could be considered such as Ken Green Lantern Ken Circuit Ken Bear Ken Master Ken These would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open up new markets And as for Barbie needing bendable arms so she can push me away need bendable knees so can kick the bitch to the curb Bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations we ve talked about this issue before In closing would like to point out that any further concessions to the blond bimbo from hell will result in action being taken by myself and others And Barbie can forget about having Joe he mine at least that what he said last night Sincerely Kenman goes to the doctor and says Doc would like to live very long What should do think that is wise decision the doctor replies Let see do you smoke Oh Half pack day Starting NOW no more smoking The man agrees The doctor then asks Do you drink

sex Yeah once week or so only with my wife he adds hurriedly As soon as you get out of here you are going to buy twin beds No more sex for you None The man is appalled Doc Are you sure going to live

regularly practice software testing There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so that companies like these can market new products said Ken Grandola spokesperson for PETS Alternative methods of testing these products are available According to PETS these companies force software to undergo lengthy and arduous tests often without rest for hours or days at time Employees are assigned to break the software by any means necessary and inside sources report that they often joke about torturing the software It no joke said Grandola Innocent programs from the day they are compiled are cooped up in tiny rooms and crashed for hours on end They spend their whole lives on dirty ill maintained computers and are unceremoniously deleted when they re not needed anymore Grandola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs We know that alternatives to this horror exist he said citing industry giant Microsoft Corporation as company that has become successful without resorting to software testingWhy do they call it PMS Because the name MAD COW DISEASE was takenYo mamma so fat when she was floating in the ocean Spain claimed her for

projects make great hammocks in spite of what the humans may tell you For people paying bills monthly activity or working on income taxes or Christmas cards annual activity keep in mind the aim to hamper First sit on the paper being worked on When dislodged watch sadly from the side of the table When activity proceeds nicely roll around on the papers scattering them to the best of your ability After being removed for the second time push pens pencils and erasers off the table one at time When human is holding the newspaper in front of him her be sure to jump on the back of the paper They love to jump WALKING As often as possible dart quickly and as close as possible in front of the human especially on stairs when they have something in their arms in the dark and when they first get up in the morning This will help their coordination skills BEDTIME Always sleep on the human at night so he cannot move round PLAY This is an important part of your life Get enough sleep in the daytime so you are fresh for your nocturnal games Below are listed several favorite cat games that you can play It is important though to maintain one Dignity at all times If you should have an accident during play such as falling off chair immediately wash part of your body as if to say MEANT to do that It fools those humans every time CAT GAMES Catch Mouse The humans would have you believe that those lumps under the covers are their feet and hands They are lying They are actually Bed Mice rumored to be the most delicious of all the mice in the world though no cat has ever been able to catch one Rumor also has it that only the most ferocious attack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get them Maybe YOU can be the first to taste the Bed Mouse King of the Hill This game must be played with at least one other cat The more the merrier One or both of the sleeping humans is Hill 303 which must be defended at all costs from the other cat Anything goes This game allows for the development of unusual tactics as one must take the unstable playing theater into account WARNING Playing either of these games to excess will result in expulsion from the bed and possibly from the bedroom Should the humans grow restless immediately begin purring and cuddle up to them This should buy you some time until they fall asleep again If one happens to be on human when this occurs this cat wins the round of King of the Hill TOYS Any small item is potential toy If human tries to confiscate it this means that it is Good Toy Run with it under the bed Look suitably outraged when the human grabs you and takes it away Always watch where it is put so you can steal it later Two reliable sources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets There are several types of cat toys Bright shiny things like keys brooches or coins should be hidden so that the other cat or humans can play with them They are generally good for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors Dangly and or string like things such as shoelaces cords gold chains and dental floss also make excellent toys They are favorites of humans who like to drag them across the floor for us to pounce on When string is dragged under newspaper or throw rug it magically becomes the Paper Rug Mouse and should be killed at all costs Take care though Humans are sneaky and will try to make you lose your Dignity PAPER BAGS Within paper bags dwell the Bag Mice They are small and camouflaged to be the same color as the bag so they are hard to see But you can easily hear the crinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag Anything up to and including shredding the bag can be done to kill them Note any other cat you may find in bag hunting for Bag Mice is fair game for Sneak Attack which will usually result in great Tag match FOOD In order to get the energy to sleep play and hamper cat must eat Eating however is only half the fun The other half is getting the food Cats have two ways to obtain food convincing human you are starving to death and must be fed NOW and hunting for it oneself The following are guidelines for getting fed When the humans are eating make sure you leave the tip of your tail in their dishes when they are not looking Never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the table Never drink from your own water bowl if human glass is full enough to drink from Should you catch something of your own outside it is only polite to attempt to get to know it Be insistent your food will usually not be so polite and try to leave Table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately unwilling to readily part It is beneath the Dignity of cat to beg outright for food as lower forms of life such as dogs will but several techniques exist for ensuring that the humans don forget you exist These include but are not limited to jumping onto the lap of the softest human and purring loudly lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the kitchen the Direct Stare and twining around people legs as they sit and eat while meowing plaintively SLEEPING As mentioned above in order to have enough energy for playing cat must get plenty of sleep It is generally not difficult to find comfortable place to curl up Any place human likes to sit is good especially if it contrasts with your fur color If it in sunbeam or near heating duct or radiator so much the better Of course good places also exist outdoors but have the disadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on current and previous weather conditions such as rain Open windows are good compromise SCRATCHING POSTS It is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide They are very protective of what they think is their property and will object strongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it Being sneaky and doing it when they aren around won help as they are very observant If you are an outdoor kitty trees are good Sharpening your claws on human is definite no no HUMANS Humans have three primary functions to feed us to play with and give attention to us and to clean the litter box It is important to maintain one Dignity when around humans so that they will not forget who is the master of the house Humans need to know basic rules They can be taught if you start early and are consistent You will then have smooth running householdman

may not even be aware you are being harassed Worse yet you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident Following are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed If you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of group may ask the same question repeatedly Untreated these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years If you are asked technical question by non technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous Most non technical people are not capable of remembering true technical answer for more than 30 seconds If you are forced into discussion where

themselves clean They say cats have special enzyme of some sort in their saliva that works like new improved Wisk dislodging the dirt where it hides and whisking it away ve spent most of my life believing this folklore Like most blind believers ve been able to discount all the facts to the contrary the kitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt smudges that cling to the throw rug by the fireplace The time comes however when man must face reality when he must look squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary and announce This cat smells like port potty on hot day in Juarez When that day arrives at your house as it has in mine have some advice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you arm and head for the bathtub Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life you have the advantage of strength Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield Don try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him Pick very small bathroom If your bathroom is more than four feet square recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding glass doors as if you were about to take shower simple shower curtain will not do berserk cat can shred three ply rubber shower curtain quicker than politician can shift positions Know that cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself recommend canvas overalls tucked into high top construction boots pair of steel mesh gloves an army helmet hockey face mask and long sleeve flak jacket Prepare everything in advance There is no time to go out for towel when you have cat digging hole in your flak jacket Draw the water Make sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure Make sure the towel can be reached even if you are lying on your back in the water Use the element of surprise Pick up your cat nonchalantly as if to simply carry him to his supper dish Cats will not usually notice your strange attire They have little or no interest in fashion as rule If he does notice your garb calmly explain that you are taking part in product testing experiment for Penney Once you are inside the bathroom speed is essential to survival In single liquid motion shut the bathroom door step into the tub enclosure slide the glass door shut dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life Cats have no handles Add the fact that he now has soapy fur and the problem is radically compounded Do not expect to hold on to him for more that two or three seconds at time When you have him however you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy He ll then spring free and fall back into the water thereby rinsing himself off The national record is for cats three latherings so don expect too much Next the cat must be dried Novice cat bathers always assume this part will be the most difficult for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined In fact the drying is simple compared to what you have just been through That because by now the cat is semi permanently affixed to your right leg You simply pop the drain plug with your foot reach for your towel and wait Occasionally however the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet If this happens the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg After all the water is drained from the tub it is simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat In few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend lot of time sitting with his back to you He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of plaster figurine You will be tempted to assume he is angry This isn usually the case As rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him bath But at least now he smells lot betterAn 80 year old couple were having problems remembering things so they decided to go to their doctor to get checked out to make sure nothing was wrong with them When they arrived at the doctor

going He replies To the kitchen She asks Will you get me bowl of ice cream He replies Sure She then asks him Don you think you should write it down so you can remember it He says No can remember that She then says Well also would like some strawberries on top You had better write that down cause know you ll forget that He says can remember that you want bowl of ice cream with strawberries She replies Well also would like whip cream on top know you will forget that so you better write it down With irritation in his voice he says don need to write that down can remember that He then fumes

heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by materials researchers at IPRT ISU The new element tentatively named Administratium has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic weight of However it does have one neuron 125 assistant neutrons 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons This gives it an atomic mass of 312 These 312 particles are held together in nucleus by force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons Since it has no electrons Administratium is totally inert However it can be detected chemically since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with According to its discovers tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete the normal reaction time is less than one second Administratium has normal half life of approximately three years at which time it does not actually decay but instead undergoes reorganization in which neutrons vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere It tends to concentrate at certain points such as governmental agencies large corporations and universities It is always found in the newest best appointed and best maintained buildings Scientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage but results to date are not promisingNow lay me down to sleep pray my sanity to keep For if some peace do not find pretty

lived woman who had maddening passion for baked beans She loved them but unfortunately they had always had very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her Then one day she met guy and fell in love When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself He is such sweet and gentle man he would never go for this carrying on So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home On her way she passed small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand Since she still had miles to walk she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home So she stopped at the diner and before she knew it she had consumed three large orders of baked beans All the way home she putt putted And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly Darling have surprise for dinner tonight He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife the telephone rang He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned He then went to answer the phone The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity shifted her weight to one leg and let it go It was not only loud but it smelled like fertilizer truck running over skunk in front of pulpwood mill She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously Then she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more which reminded her of cabbage cooking Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room she went on like this for another ten minutes When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom she fanned the air few more times with her napkin placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it smiling contentedly to herself She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned Apologizing for taking so long he asked her if she peeked and she assured him that she had not At this point he removed the blindfold and she was surprised There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her Happy BirthdayWhat do you call something that is 12 inches long and hangs infront of an arsehole Tony Blair TIEwhat did the tampon say to the next tampon see you next

but contrary to hypothesis birds even pigeons avoided this potential source of substance Despite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun the Twinkie retained its original color and form When removed the Twinkie was found to be substantially dehydrated Cracked open it was observed to have taken on the consistency of industrial foam insulation the filling however retained its advertised creaminess Twinkie was placed in conventional microwave oven which was set for precisely minutes the approximate cooking time of bacon After 20 seconds the oven began to emit the Twinkie rich characteristic aroma of artificial butter After one minute this aroma began to resemble the acrid smell of burning rubber The experiment was aborted after minutes 10 seconds when thick foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven second Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment this Twinkie leaked molten white filling When cooled this now epoxylike filling bonded the Twinkie to its plate defying gravity it was removed only upon application of butter knife Twinkie was dropped from ninth floor window fall of approximately 120 feet It landed right side up then bounced onto its back The expected splatter effect was not observed Indeed the only discernible damage to the Twinkie was narrow fissure on its underside otherwise the Twinkie remained structurally intact Twinkie was placed in conventional freezer for 24 hours Upon removal the Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid but its physical properties had noticeably slowed The filling was found to be the approximate consistency of acrylic paint while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering to practically any surface It was noticed the Twinkie had generously absorbed the freezer odors Twinkie was exposed to gas flame for minutes While the Twinkie smoked and blackened and the filling in one of its cream holes boiled the Twinkie did not catch fire It did however produce the same burning rubber aroma noticed in the irradiation experiment Twinkie was dropped into large bucket filled with water the Twinkie floated momentarily then began to list and sink Viscous yellow tendrils ran off its lower half possibly consisting of water soluble artificial coloring After hours the Twinkie bloated substantially Its coloring was now very pale tan in contrast to the yellow urine like water that surrounded it The Twinkie bobbed when touched and had gelatinous texture After 72 hours the Twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of its original size The water had turned opaque and small fan shaped spray of filling had leaked from one of the cream holes Unfortunately efforts to remove the Twinkie for further analysis were abandoned when under light pressure the Twinkie disintegrated into an amorphous cloud of debris distinctly sour odor was noted The Twinkie survival of 120 foot drop along with some of the unusual phenomena associated with the creamy filling and artificial coloring should give pause to those observers who would unequivocally categorize the Twinkie as food Further clinical inquiry is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn Greg Ricker Westinghouse

deal He would have religious debate with member of the Jewish community If the Jew won the Jews could stay If the Pope won the Jews would leave The Jews realized that they had no choice So they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them Rabbi Moishe Latin wasn very good in fact he knew very little but he was man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community The pope agreed What could be easier than silent debate The day of the great debate came Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger The Pope waved his fingers in circle around his head Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat The Pope pulled out wafer and glass of wine Moishe pulled out an apple The Pope stood up and said give up This man is too good The Jews can stay An hour later the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened The Pope said First held up three fingers to represent the Trinity He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions Then waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin He had an answer for everything What could do Meanwhile the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe What happened they asked Well said Moishe First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here told him that not one of us was leaving Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews let him know that we were staying right here And

best lawyer story of the year decade and probably the century Charlotte NC lawyer purchased box of very rare and expensive cigars then insured them against fire among other things Within month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy the lawyer filed claim against the insurance company In his claim the lawyer stated the cigars were lost in series of small fires The insurance company refused to pay citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion The lawyer sued and won In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous The Judge stated nevertheless that the lawyer held policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire and was obligated to pay the claim Rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid 15 000 00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the fires NOW FOR THE BEST PART After the lawyer cashed the check the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON With his own insurance claim andtestimony from the previous case being used against him the lawyer was convicted of

realized that if they continued their arms race they were going to blow up the whole planet They arranged top secret summit where it was decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight They agreed to give each other5 years to breed the two most powerful fighting dogs ever The winning dog country would be entitled to dominate the world The losing side would have to submit and lay down its arms The Russians searched their vast country to find the meanest most vicious Doberman and Rottweiler breeds and crossed them with the biggest most dangerous Siberian wolves They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter and fed it diet of steroids and trained them to be lethal attack dogs After five years of fierce breeding Russiahad managed to create the biggest most vicious dog the world had ever seen Finally Russia and America met in Switzerland to let their dogs fight for world domination Although its cage had inch thick reinforced steel bars everyone was afraid to even go near the Russian monster dog When the Russians saw the American dog they burst into laughter America had sent weird looking foot long Dachshund The Russian breeders felt little sorry for the Dachshund because they knew it didn have the slightest chance to last even 10 seconds against Russia killer When the bell announced the beginning of the fight the Russian dog leaped out of its cage snarled and charged the American Dachshund The Dachshund slowly waddled out of its cage towards the Russian dog But just when the Russian champion looked like it was going to bite the Dachshund neck the Dachshund opened its mouth and swallowed the Russian dog with one bite The Russian monster was gone The Russian politicians shaking their heads in disbelief walked over to the cheering Americans and said We don understand how this could have happened We had our best breeders working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler breeds in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves That nothing an American replied We had our best plastic surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like Dachshundlittle boy goes to the drugstore for some condoms He

heads together Then they decide to deploy council to make research The group visits Japanese car factory and notice something strange Everywhere in the factory there are lots of cats wandering around One of the American group members asks the general manager of the factory about the cats He replies we put cat into each completed product at nights then if one is alive next morning that means there is something wrong with the isolation of that unit so we unassemble it and fix it Americans were amazed Then it was time to see what it was like in Turkey they came to TOFAS factory for their search And they were again surprised as they saw cats like they used in Japan and they asked again about the cats General manager answer was we put cat in each completed unit at night if it the cat is missing in the morning it means we have some problem with the isolation of that unitAt recent computer expo 1996 COMDEX Bill Gates compared the computer industry to the automotive indusrty by stating If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has we would all be driving cars that cost 25 00 and get 00 miles to the gallon In response to Bills comment General Motors issued press release making the following statement If we GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics for no reson whatsoever your car would crash twice per day Every time they repainted the lines in the road you would have to buy new car Your car would occasionally stop on the freeway without reason In order to get started again you would have to pull off to the side of the road close all the windowsshut off the car resart it and open all the windows again For some unknown reason you would simply do this without question Occasionally executing maneuver such as left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to resart in which case you would have to reinstall the engine Only one person could use the car at one time unless you bought Car95 or CarNT but then you would also have to buy more seats The new seats you would need would force everyone to have the same size butt You would press the start button to shut off the engine The oil warning light water warning light and alternator warning light would all be replaced by single Unidentified System Error light The air bag would ask ur freshly mangled body are you sure before going off 10 Occasionally for no reason whatsoever your car would lock you out and refuse to let you back inuntill you simultaneously lifted the driver side door handle turned the key and grabbed the radio antenna 11 The radio antenna would be internally mounted on the passenger side of the car 12 buying new car would force you to also purchase new set of Deluxe Rand McNally road maps dispite the fact that you niether need nor want them Attempting to delet this otion would immediately cause your cars performance to diminish by 50 or more 13 every time GM introduced new car people would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the old controls would function in the new car 14 Macintosh would make car that was five times faster ten times more reliable and

gathered his Lawyer Doctor and Clergyman at his bed side and handed each of them an envelope containing 25 000 in cash He made them each promise that after his death and during his repose they would place the three envelopes in his coffin He told them that he wanted to have enough money to enjoy the next life week later the man died At the Wake the Lawyer and Doctor and Clergyman each concealed an envelope in the coffin and bid their old client and friend farewell By chance these three met several months later Soon the Clergyman feeling guilty blurted out confession saying that there was only 10 000 in the envelope he placed in the coffin He felt rather than waste all the money he would send it to Mission in South America He asked for their forgiveness The Doctor moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity confessed that he too had kept some of the money for worthy medical charity The envelope he admitted had only 8000 in it He said he too could not bring himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to benefit others By this time the Lawyer was seething with self righteous outrage He expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his

been running the original version of DrinkingBuddies as my primary application and all the GirlFriend releases ve tried have always conflicted with it hear that DrinkingBuddies won crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is turned off But embarrassed to say can find the switch to turn the sound off just run them separately and it works okay GirlFriend also seems to have problem co existing with my Golf program often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility probably should have stayed with GirlFriend but thought might see better performance from GirlFriend After months of conflicts and other problems consulted friend who has had experience with GirlFriend He said probably didn have enough cache to run GirlFriend and eventually it would require Token Ring to run properly He was right as soon as purged my cache it uninstalled itself Shortly after that installed GirlFriend beta All the bugs were supposed to be gone but the first time used it it gave me virus had to clean out my whole system and shut down for while very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend This time used SCSI probe first and also installed virus protection program It worked okay for while until discovered that GirlFriend was still in my system tried running GirlFriend again with GirlFriend still installed but GirlFriend has feature didn know about that automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some way which results in the immediate removal of both versions The version have now works pretty well but there are still some problems Like all versions of GirlFriend it is written in some obscure language can understand much less reprogram Frankly think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality Also to get the best connections with your hardware you usually have to use gold plated contacts And ve never liked how GirlFriend is totally object oriented year ago friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus which is Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend He discovered that GirlFriendPlus expires within year if you don upgrade to Fiancé So he did but soon after that he had to upgrade to Wife which he describes as huge resource hog It has taken up all his space so he can load anything else One of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus Well it turns out that the resource allocation module of Wife sometimes prohibits access to FreeSexPlus particularly the new Plug Ins he wanted to try On top of that Wife must be running on well warmed up system before he can do anything Although he did not ask for it Wife also came with MotherInLaw which has an automatic pop up feature he can turn off told him to try installing Mistress but he said he heard that if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife Wife will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself Then Mistress won install anyway because of insufficient resourcesOne day man walks into dentist office and asks how much it will cost to extract wisdom teeth Eighty

possessors of this potential including the species of domestic rodent known as Mus Musculus Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric apparatus pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of Saint Nicholas The prepubescent siblings comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums My conjugal partner and attired in our nocturnal head coverings were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such cacophony of dissonance that felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof Hastening to the casement forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration Noting hereupon that the lunar brilliance without reflected as it was on the surface of recent crystalline precipitation might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself Thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer Piloted by minuscule aged chauffer so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators he vociferated loudly expelled breath musically through contracted labia and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen Now Dasher now Dancer

entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebon residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof His resemblance to street vendor attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in commodious cloth receptacle His orbs were scintillating with reflected luminosity while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability The capillaries of his molar regions and nasal protuberance were engorged with blood which suffused in subcutaneous layers the former approximating the coloration of Albion floral emblem the later that of the Prunus Avium or Sweet Cherry His amusing sub and supra labials resembled nothing so much as common loop knot and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small tabular and columnar crystals being Clenched firmly between his incisors was smoking piece whose gray fumes forming tenuous ellipse about his occiput were suggestive of decorative seasonal circlet of holly His visage was wider than it was high and when he waxed audibly mirthful his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of pectinous fruit syrup in hemispherical container He was in short neither more or less than obese jocund multigenarian gnome the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head to one side he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless Without utterance and with dispatch he commenced filling the afore mentioned hosiery with various of the afore mentioned articles of merchandise extracted from his afore mentioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle Upon completion of his task he executed an abrupt about face placed singular manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ inclined his cranium forward in gesture of leave taking and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating in reverse the smoke passage He propelled himself in short vector onto his conveyance directed musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden and proceeded to soar aloft in movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed bearing portions of common weed But overheard his parting exclamation audibly immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency and to that self same assemblage my sincerest wishes for salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly

professor asks the class if the jar is full they agree that it is The professor then takes handful of pebbles and adds them to the jar shaking it so the pebbles fill the cracks and asks if the jar is full and again the class agrees The professor produces small bag of sand and proceeds to add it to the jar shaking it so it fill the cracks and asks the class if the jar is full and for the third time they agreed it is Now the professor says want you to use this jar full of sediment as way of looking at your life the rocks represent the things that are most important to you your family your partner and your health things that are the cornerstone of your life The pebbles represent things like your money your job or your dwelling things that are important but can be replaced The sand represents the small things in your life for instance what you wear who you are seen with or where you eat You ll find if you put the sand in the jar first you won have enough room for not only the pebbles but most importantly the rocks The same thing goes for your life if you spend too much time and energy on the small issues you focus less on the things that really matter Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take your spouse out on date and find time for that medical checkup in essences set your priorities you must take care of the rocks first then let the pebbles and sand fill your jar As the professor finishes he receives standing ovation for his presentation but through the crowd comes pupil from the back of the room wearing backpack He goes to front of the class takes bottle of beer out opens it and pours it into the professor jar The student asks the professor would you say the jar now full The stunned professor could only watch as the student answered his own question then we must conclude that no mater how full your life is there always room for beerTop Ten Reasons Hurricane Season is Like Christmas 10 Up on ladder in bad weather

people of Florida are holding this election hostage When YOU promise to stop sending us YOUR old people we will release YOUR electionIn the beginning there was chaos and the Universe was without form and void The Lord looked upon His domain and decided to declare His presence be he said then to correct his grammar added am If the Lord had decided to work on irregular verb conjugation first this wouldn have happened God would later curse the English language for its part but in that moment IBM came into being The Lord looked out upon the IBM He had created and said This is good That what He said but He shook his head wondered what the boys at the User Group would say split the light from the dark and went to bed Thus passed the Beginning and the end of the first day On the second day the Lord summoned IBM unto His presence There is chaos out there and the Universe is without form and void must correct this and can use your help Is there anything you can do for me can take care of form IBM replied Put me in charge of computers and will take care of form for you The Lord thought that this was good and said Let there be computers Let IBM have my powers of creation that pertain to computers and form Thus saying the Lord went off to His second day work while IBM created the 1401 On the third day while the Lord was out IBM decided to subdivide the assgined task Let there be systems that make the computer work and let them be called Operating Systems Let there also be systems that make use of the computer and let them be called Application Systems Thus there came into being both Operating Systems and Application Systems but there were no programmers The next morning IBM had to give the Lord status report What did you do yesterday the Lord asked invented the operating system IBM replied You did the Lord shuddered Oh dear Yes did IBM confirmed but find need something you alone can provide And what is that need programmers to use my computers to operate my operating system and to apply my applications That can be done now said the Lord This is only the fourth day and there won be people until the sixth day need programmers and need them now If they can be people they can be people but we have to work this out today Give me some specifications and ll see what can do IBM hastily worked up specs for programmers are specs ever anything other than hasty and the Lord reviewed them The Lord knew the specs weren sufficient but followed them anyway He also made some programmers that did just what programmers were supposed to do just to spite IBM The programmers and IBM spent the rest of the day creating the Assembler and FORTRAN On the morning of the fifth day IBM reported to the Lord once again The programmers you created for me have problem They want programming language that is easy to use and similar to English told them you had cursed English though still don know why They wanted me to ask your indulgence on this The Lord had cursed English for good reason but didn want to explain this to IBM He said let there be COBOL and that was that On the status report of the next day IBM announced that computers had gone forth and multiplied Unfortunately the computers still weren big enough or fast enough to do what the programmers wanted The Lord liked the idea of going forth multiplying and used the line Himself later on that day This sixth day being particularly busy He declared Let there be MVS and there was MVS On the seventh day God had finished creation and computers had COBOL and MVS The Lord and IBM took the day off to go fishing IBM hung sign on the door to help programmers in his absence On the start of the second week the programmers went over IBM cathode ray tube directly to God We have horrible problem they complained Our users want systems that perform according to their expectations USERS the Lord bellowed Who said that you should have users Users are the difference between good and bad applications function have reserved unto myself Who authorized you to have users Well IBM IBM You You did this to my programmers You gave them the knowledge of good and evil For that you shall suffer through eternity Let there be competition Let it be called Anacom and Burroughs and CDC The Lord went through the alphabet several times With all this competition you shall still suffer the pain of

imposing cat with the biggest belly in history That shook when he laughed like bowlful of Friskies grimalkin of breed right jolly old cat Did say grimalkin how could think that twitch of the whisker and twist of his head Soon gave me to know had nothing to dread He mewed not sound but went straight to his work Filled my stockings with kitty treats then turned with jerk And laying talon aside of his nose After giving nod out the cat door he goes He sprang to his cat box to his team gave MEOW And away they all flew like the wind they did howl But heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight

Pope challenged the Jewish community of Rome to debate The Jews looked around for champion who could defend their faith but no one wanted to volunteer It was too risky So they finally picked an old man named Moishe who spent his life sweeping up after people to represent them Being old and poor he had less to lose so he agreed He asked only for one addition to the rules of debate Not being used to saying very much he asked that neither side be allowed to talk The Pope agreed The day of the great debate came Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger The Pope waved his fingers in circle around his head Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat The Pope pulled out wafer and glass of wine Moishe pulled out an apple The Pope stood up and said give up This man is too good The Jews win An hour later the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened The Pope said First held up three fingers to represent the Trinity He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions Then waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us He responded by pointing to the ground showing that God was also right here with us pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin He had an answer for everything What could do Meanwhile the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe amazed that this old almost feeble minded man had done what all their scholars had insisted was impossible What happened they asked Well said Moishe first he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here told him that not one of us was leaving Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews let him know that we were staying right here And then asked woman don know said Moishe He took out his lunch and

invoices were printing noticed something on the package of paper that concerned me and thought better check with you about it On the box there is little thing that says 99 99 jam free know that sometimes wood finds its way into paper but jam was always taught to keep all food and drinks away from computer equipment especially something as sticky as jam Now realize that it is very small amount of jam in each piece of paper but we use an awful LOT of paper my friends and all that jam is sure to add up Won that adversely affect the life of our printer mean sure you know what you re doing when it comes to paper but we use more than the average consumer so maybe we would be better off with Jam free paper if you offer such product will look for it next time am shopping which will be soon as don want to use any more of this paper until find out if it really safe If it is safe why not say Contains 01 jam but it perfectly safe in big letters since sure that am not the only one who has this concern You may end up selling lot more paper that way By the way curious as to why you would even put jam in paper Does it help bond everything together so it doesn look like confettii Just curious Also appreciate Xerox keychain Thanks Dave Cilluffo PO Box 731 Edinboro Pa 16412 0731 Thank you for your message We greatly appreciate your taking the time to send us your feedback regarding our 99 99 jam free paper We have restricted the manufacture of paper to the morning because we have so many folks who eat jam for lunch Nevertheless it has been our experience that small amounts of jam have found its way into the paper via morning bagels and jam filled donuts Our tests have shown that the 01 jam isn harmful to machinery and you may continue to use it In fact the jam has improved the overall quality of the finished print However you may have to keep can of ant spray around You may wish to enhance paper performance by using the 99 99 jam free paper with our new line of 99 99 peanut butter free paper They absolutely work best when used together Or if you prefer you can save time by using the 99 99 PB free paper Whatever you choose we are sure you will be

for study by Christians The Board announced that in the future it would be taking on other hoaxes such as the dinosaur conspiracy and the silly idea of heliocentric so called solar system They will also be working on publishing the New Kansas Dictionary reference book similar to the New American Dictionary except that it will omit objectionable words and terms like Paleozoic Mesozoic Jurassic

The moral of the story If the government offers you anything there going to be string attachedAugust 1998 Montevideo Uruguay Paolo Esperanza bass trombonist with the Simphonica Mayor de Uruguay in misplaced moment of inspiration decided to make his own contribution to the cannon shots fired as part of the orchestra performance of Tchaikovsky 1812 Overture at an outdoorchildren concert In complete seriousness he placed large ignited firecracker supposedly equivalent in strength to quarter stick of dynamite into his aluminum straight mute and then stuck the mute into the bell of his quite new Yamaha in line double valve bass trombone Later from his hospital bed he explained to reporter through bandages on his mouth thought that the bell of my trombone would shield me from the explosion and instead would focus the energy of the blast outwards and away from me propelling the mute high above the orchestra like rocket However Paolo was not up on his propulsion physics nor qualified to use high powered artillery In his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra What actually happened should serve as lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration First because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience Fortunately the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury for the chairs collapsed under them passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on like row of dominos The sound of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the Overture Meanwhile all of this unplanned choreography notwithstanding back on stage Paolo Waterloo was still unfolding According to Paolo Just as heard the sound of the blast time seemed to stand still Everything moved in slow motion Just before felt searing pain to my mouth could swear heard voice with an Austrian accent say Fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul unopposeet reakshon Well this should come as no surprise for Paolo had set himself up for textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics Having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone he allowed the energy of the blast to send superheated jet of gas backwards through the tubing of the trombone through the mouthpiece burning his lips and face The pyrotechnic ballet wasn over yet The force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny Yamaha right down the middle turning it inside out while at the same time propelling Paolo backwards off the riser And for the grand finale as Paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone slide like double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist knocking him unconscious The moral of the story Beware the next time you hear someone in the horn section yell out Hey everyone watch thisrich lonely widow decided that she needed another
